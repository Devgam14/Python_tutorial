person_name = "James"
user_name : int = "Peter"
user_age : int  = "23"
person_age : int = "23"
person_salary : float = "12345.98"
PERSON_CONST = "change"
##### Normal Concat Approach 
print("My name is "+ person_name + " I am " + user_age + " years old")
print("User Name is ::::: " + user_name + " His salary is ::::: " + person_salary)

### second example of normal concat 

users_name = "John Doe"
other_name = "Matt"
full_name = "My name is " + users_name + ", My other name is " + other_name
print(full_name)

my_id = "12233";
user_location = "Lagos"
users_age = "34"

print("Id :::: " + my_id + ", My location :::: " + user_location + ", age :::: " + users_age)
